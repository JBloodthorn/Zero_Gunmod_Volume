# Zero Gunmod Volume
A mod for the game Cataclysm: Bright Nights. Sets the integral volume of all 94 vanilla gunmods to zero, which prevents them from negatively affecting aim time when installed.

## Notes:

This includes integral mods that come pre-installed in some weapons, like the KSG-25.

This also includes several items that probably should increase the volume of the gun, but probably shouldn't increase aim time, like the pistol stock.
