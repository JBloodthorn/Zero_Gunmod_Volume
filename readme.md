# Zero Gunmod Volume
A mod for the game Cataclysm: Bright Nights. Sets the integral volume of all 94 vanilla gunmods to zero, which prevents them from negatively affecting aim time when installed.

## Notes:

This includes integral mods that come pre-installed in some weapons, like the KSG-25.

This also includes several items that probably should increase the volume of the gun, but probably shouldn't increase aim time, like the pistol stock.

Some gunmods were already set to zero. I included them anyway, in case they change in the future.
